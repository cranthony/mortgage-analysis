# Setup

These scripts use Python.  I installed Python3.10 for this, which can be
installed using the Microsoft Store app.  It might take you there by executing
`python3.10` in Powershell.

After Python3.10 is installed, you'll need to install a couple of packages.
Run the following on the Windows Command Prompt or Powershell:

```
python3.10 -m pip install matplotlib numpy
```

# Running the scripts.

`mortgage_context.py` is a helper script.  The other scripts allow you to plot
stuff.  You can run them using Python3.10:

```
python3.10 <script_name>
```
